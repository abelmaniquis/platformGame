Hello, If you are reading this from Thinkful, I decided to work on a different project than the
Pirate Bartender Project for the Object Oriented Programming section.

This is based on Chapter 15 of Eloquent Javascript.

Dark Box: Player
Yellow Boxes: Coins.
Red Stuff: Lava

A level is completed when all coins have been collected.

The player will walk around with the left and right arrow keys, and jump with the up arrow.

The character can jump several times its own height, and is able to change directions midair.

Game consists of a fixed background, and elements laid on that background.

Use the Browser DOM to display the game
